# Movie Recommendation System Preparation Repository

This repository serves as a preparation guide for building a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using machine learning techniques. We explore different types of recommendation engines and focus on content-based recommendation engines in particular.

## Types of Recommendation Engines:

1. **Popularity Based**: This straightforward engine recommends movies based on their popularity, usually determined by metrics like view counts or ratings.
2. **Content Based**: Our primary focus, this engine suggests movies similar to the user's preferences by analyzing movie contents such as storyline, genre, cast, and director.
3. **Collaborative Filtering Based**: This algorithm identifies similar users based on their activities and preferences, recommending movies based on their collaborative preferences.

## Overview:

- **Popularity Based**: Utilizes view counts or ratings to recommend movies in descending order of popularity.
- **Content Based**: Analyzes movie contents to suggest similar movies based on shared attributes like genre, cast, and director.
- **Collaborative Filtering Based**: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users, enhancing recommendations through collaboration.

By exploring these approaches and focusing on content-based recommendation systems, we lay the groundwork for implementing our movie recommendation system using the scikit-learn library.
